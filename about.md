I'm Mike Sanders, and this is my blog.  I primarily write about data, data science, and technology, but I always allow room for general nerdery because it's fun.

Why "Mike_S(n)"?  There are a lot of us named Mike S.  Eventually, `for n in Mike_S` you'll find me. ;)

This entire site is a work in progress, and I promise there is more to come on this page and in the blog.  Stay tuned!
