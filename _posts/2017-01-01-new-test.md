## Well, here goes nothing

This is my first blog post.  I will be expanding this post as I continue building out the site, adding new features, and testing it.  While it might not be best practice to draft and iterate on the public facing site, I am doing it anyway :)  Break stuff and fix it, I say.

I'm using Github's free Github Pages service to host this site, as well as Jekyll.  Setting this up was relatively straightforward given a relatively decent level of technical ability.  

After a lot of trial and error (especially while trying to parse how this works with Jekyll), I came across a great, simple, step-by-step how-to blog for [setting up your Github Pages website:] (http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/)

Github Pages uses Jekyll, which means that you can write posts and create pages using Markdown (or raw HTML if you are so inclined).  I'm not so into writing HTML, so Markdown is appealing.  However, I wanted to make sure I could still embed rich content in my posts from other sites.  In particular, Tableau dashboards.  

After a deep trip down the Google rabbit hole, I found the simple answer that was staring me in the face:  Markdown has syntax for embedding raw HTML within a Markdown file:

    [curly brace]% raw %[curly brace]
    [your HTML here]
    {% endraw %}

(Note, Markdown doesn't seem to want to display Markdown code as non-executing code blocks.  Unless I'm missing something obvious, but it seems a bit meta.  Hence, the "[curly brace]" notation above refers to {})

In the `[your HTML here]` placeholder, you can, for example, use HTML to create an iframe in order to embed the external embeddable content of your choosing.  Here's a very simple Tableau dashboard I made using the SAT data from our current GA DSI project:

{% raw %}
<iframe src="https://public.tableau.com/views/testhistogram/Sheet1?:embed=y&:display_count=yes"
 width="645" height="955"></iframe>
{% endraw %}

To accomplish this, I simply included the following code in my Markdown file:


    [curly brace]% raw %[close curly brace]
    <iframe src="https://public.tableau.com/views/testhistogram/Sheet1?:embed=y&:display_count=yes"
 width="645" height="955"></iframe>
    [curly brace]% endraw %[close curly brace]

Why not try the same with a YouTube video?

{% raw %}
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZXsQAXx_ao0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
{% endraw %}

Here's the embed code:

    [curly brace]% raw %[close curly brace]
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZXsQAXx_ao0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    [curly brace]% endraw %[close curly brace]

More to come!
